# InstaToEtsy Enhancement Migration - Copilot Chat Memory

## Context
- Migrating enhancements from a modified InstaToEtsy project to a clean branch based on https://github.com/GSCrawley/auto_etsy
- Previous enhancements included: Google Vision API content filtering, improved logging, workflow transparency, and modularization
- Issues encountered: Logging not working in enhanced version, likely due to multiple logging configs and import order
- Plan: Systematically port enhancements to a new branch, testing after each step

## Steps Completed
1. Cloned original repo to a new directory and created a new branch (`enhanced-instagram-to-etsy`)
2. Set up a new Python virtual environment in the new project directory
3. Ready to test baseline logging and functionality in the clean branch before porting enhancements

## Next Steps
- Run the main script in the clean branch and confirm logging works (both terminal and log file)
- If logging works, port enhancements one at a time, testing after each
- If logging does not work, debug logging in the original code before porting enhancements

## Key Details to Resume
- Main enhancements: Google Vision API integration, content filtering, robust logging, modular workflow
- Only configure logging in the main entry point, not in modules
- Use `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` in modules
- Test after each enhancement
